- **Timing Data**: Begin time, peak time, and end time
- **Source Location**: Where on the Sun the flare originated
- **Instruments**: Which spacecraft detected the flare
- **Active Region**: Solar magnetic field region numbers

#### Flare Classification System
Understanding the intensity scale:

**X-Class Flares** (Most Intense)
- Can cause planet-wide radio blackouts
- Can damage satellites and power grids
- Can disrupt GPS and communications
- May trigger spectacular aurora displays

**M-Class Flares** (Medium Intensity)
- Can cause brief radio blackouts
- May affect satellite operations
- Can enhance aurora activity
- Generally pose minimal threat to technology

**C-Class Flares** (Common)
- Minor impact on radio communications
- Minimal satellite effects
- Often go unnoticed on Earth
- Part of normal solar activity

**B-Class Flares** (Background)
- Very minimal effects
- Normal background solar activity
- No significant Earth impacts
- Detected only by sensitive instruments

#### Interactive Features
- **Real-time Updates**: Latest flare data from NASA's DONKI system
- **Timeline Views**: See flare activity over time
- **Statistical Analysis**: Distribution of flare classes
- **Impact Assessment**: Understanding of Earth-directed effects

#### What This Means for You
- **Technology Awareness**: Understanding when tech might be affected
- **Aurora Predictions**: When to look for northern/southern lights
- **Safety Information**: Aviation and satellite operation impacts
- **Scientific Interest**: Following the 11-year solar cycle

## ☄️ Near-Earth Asteroids Dashboard

### Asteroid Monitoring
Our asteroid dashboard tracks space rocks that pass relatively close to Earth, helping you understand both the wonder and potential risks of our cosmic neighborhood.

#### Key Data Points
- **Asteroid Names**: Official designations and common names
- **Size Estimates**: Diameter ranges in kilometers and miles
- **Close Approach Dates**: When asteroids pass nearest to Earth
- **Miss Distances**: How close they actually come (safely!)
- **Relative Velocity**: How fast they're traveling
- **Hazard Assessment**: Whether they're classified as potentially hazardous

#### Understanding Asteroid Data

**Size Categories:**
- **Small** (< 100m): City-block sized objects
- **Medium** (100m-1km): City-threatening if they hit
- **Large** (> 1km): Regional to global impact potential
- **Giant** (> 10km): Civilization-threatening (very rare)

**Distance Measurements:**
- **Lunar Distance (LD)**: Distance to the Moon (384,400 km)
- **Astronomical Unit (AU)**: Earth-Sun distance (149.6 million km)
- **Kilometers/Miles**: Actual distances for easy understanding

**Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHOs):**
- Larger than 140 meters in diameter
- Come within 7.5 million kilometers of Earth's orbit
- Tracked carefully by international monitoring networks
- None currently pose any immediate threat

#### Safety and Context
- **No Immediate Threats**: All tracked objects pass safely by Earth
- **Monitoring Networks**: Global telescope systems watch for new objects
- **Early Warning**: We can detect threats decades in advance
